Morelli_Project.pdf includes all the explanations.
Each jupyter file in this repository is independent. The "Arellano_original" type of files are those for the original model solved by Discrete State Space (DSS) techinque as in the original model. One version has the Howard Iterative Step (HIS) and the other has the HIS plus parallelization. Which one to use depends on the number of gridpoints, since parallelization is inefficient for a small amount of gridpoints.

Then we also have the collocations version, which uses splines to solve for the value functions. The pdf file explains the way it was solved, as well as the jupyter file itself.

Finally, there is a version of Arellano with three states. Again, both the pdf and the jupyter file explain the solution method and purpose.
